#Task
Our colleague has implemented a simple todo list. Our users like it a lot and as always they find things that can be improved.
They complain that can create a todo item with empty text.

Your `task` is to add validation that will prevent adding a todo item without text.

When you are done please send it to `engineering-career@plusdental.de`.
